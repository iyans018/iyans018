# Hi, I'm Oktavian Aji 👋  
Backend Engineer | Enterprise Systems | Fintech-Oriented

I’m a backend engineer with 3+ years of experience building and maintaining **enterprise-scale backend systems** with complex workflows, highly relational databases, and strict data consistency requirements.

My day-to-day work revolves around designing **transactional APIs**, optimizing database-heavy systems, introducing **asynchronous processing**, and integrating multiple services while keeping systems reliable, maintainable, and auditable.

I’m particularly interested in **fintech systems**, not from a hype perspective, but from the engineering challenges behind them:  
ledger consistency, approval-driven workflows, auditability, failure handling, and distributed system trade-offs.

## 🧠 Engineering Mindset

I care deeply about:
- **Correctness over cleverness**
- **Predictable state transitions**
- **Clear system boundaries**
- **Trade-offs, not silver bullets**

I strongly align with principles from *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* (DDIA):  
**reliability, scalability, and maintainability** as first-class concerns.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

**Languages**
- Python (Django, FastAPI)
- Node.js (Express)
- Go (actively upskilling)

**Data & Messaging**
- PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL
- Redis
- RabbitMQ, Celery

**Infrastructure & Tooling**
- Docker
- GitLab CI/CD
- REST APIs, OpenAPI (Swagger)

**Core Concepts**
- Transactional consistency & concurrency control  
- Approval-driven workflows  
- Asynchronous background processing  
- Audit logging & traceability  
- Distributed session & token management

## 🏢 Professional Experience (Snapshot)

At **Telkomsigma**, I work on internal enterprise platforms used by large organizations, where I’ve:

- Built **approval-based change request systems** handling sensitive data with strict consistency guarantees.
- Optimized transactional workflows and database access patterns, reducing processing time by **~50%**.
- Introduced asynchronous job pipelines to improve throughput and resilience.
- Integrated backend systems with external enterprise services (e.g. document storage) while preserving auditability.
- Designed centralized login/logout mechanisms and implemented **distributed session revocation**.
- Mentored junior engineers and standardized API design and documentation.

## 🔬 Selected Projects

### Ledger-Based Transaction System
A personal project to explore core fintech principles:
- Double-entry ledger as an append-only source of truth
- Idempotent transaction APIs
- Enforcement of financial invariants
- Concurrency and failure scenario simulation

### Distributed Payment Flow Simulation
- Modeled payment lifecycles: initiation, callbacks, retries, reversals
- Asynchronous event processing with consistency safeguards
- Tested system behavior under partial failures

These projects are **learning-focused**, designed to mirror real-world failure modes rather than production-scale adoption.

## ✍️ Writing & Knowledge Sharing

I actively write technical articles on Medium, translating hands-on backend experience into **structured, practical insights**—especially around:
- backend architecture
- system design trade-offs
- distributed systems
- engineering mindset

Writing helps me clarify thinking and communicate complex ideas simply.

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Deepening understanding of **distributed systems** and **financial backend design**
- Strengthening Go for backend and systems programming
- Expanding DevOps and infrastructure knowledge
- Preparing for **senior/technical leadership roles**
- Transitioning into **fintech-oriented backend engineering**

---

## 📌 Long-Term Vision

In the long run, I aim to:
- Lead backend teams building **reliable, high-impact systems**
- Design platforms where correctness and clarity scale with complexity
- Bridge technical depth with product and business understanding
- Build systems—and teams—that people can trust
